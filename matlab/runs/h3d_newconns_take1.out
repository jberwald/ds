===> rounding checked and no errors detected
===> rounding checked and no errors detected
===> width of display 120 characters
===> Default display of intervals with uncertainty (e.g. 3.14_) 
===> Rigorous standard functions in use
===> Complex interval stdfct used automatically for real interval input 
         out of range, but with warning
===> Improved residual calculation in verifylss
===> Verifylss for dense systems applies second stage only if first stage fails
===> Fast interval matrix multiplication in use (maximum overestimation 
         factor 1.5 in radius)
===> Real interval arrays automatically transformed to complex array 
         if a component is assigned a complex value (without warning)
===> Warning issued when complex interval defined by infsup(zinf,zsup)
===> Long arithmetic computations with error terms, i.e. valid long error bounds
===> Gradient derivative stored sparse for 50 and more unknowns
===> Warning issued when accessing .dx of sparse 2-dimensional gradient
===> Default sparse display of univariate polynomials
===> Default evaluation univariate polynomials by Horner's scheme
===> Default evaluation multivariate polynomials by sums of scaled powers
===> Polynomial function executed with warning if input polynomial does not depend on specified variable
===> Warning issued when accessing .s of sparse 2-dimensional slope
===> Hessian derivatives stored sparse for 10 and more unknowns
===> Warning issued when accessing .dx or .hx of sparse hessian array
